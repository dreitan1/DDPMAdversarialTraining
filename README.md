# DDPMAdversarialTraining

David Reitano: dreitan1

KinChin Tong: 

David has worked on the data generation code (generate_train_data.py and load_data.py) and some ablation studies (pgd_tests.py). He has also worked on generating and using data from Wang et al.'s method, since they did not record results with ResNet18 (https://github.com/wzekai99/DM-Improves-AT).

Kin has worked on implementing the diffusion model with model paramters as input and on adversrially training the ResNet18 model.
